SQL
---

SQL is a Standard Computer Database Language 


What Exactly is SQL..?

the Sql is a tool for organizing and retrieving the data stored by a computer database,
Sql stands for Structured Query language and some people will call it as "Sequel"
when we want to store something or do something in the server we need to tell that to the server in server understanding format 
how come we can tell that to the system 

the answer for the above question is by using the SQL 

SQL is a computer language that we can use to interact with the database.


SQL is an interactive query language. Users type SQL commands into an interactive 
SQL program to retrieve data and display it on the screen, providing a convenient, 
easy-to-use tool for ad hoc database queries. 
 
 
SQL is a database programming language. Programmers embed SQL commands into 
their application programs to access the data in a database. Both user-written 
programs and database utility programs (such as report writers and data entry tools) 
use this technique for database access. 




Why it is important..?



what can it do and how does it works..?

when you need to retrieves data from database we use the Sql language to make the request, the DBMS(Data base management System)
process the Sql request, retrieves data, and returns to us.

this process of requesting data from database and receiving back the results is called database QUERY -> hence the name called 
STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE 






what are the different types of SQL products..?
SQL server, Oracle, Informix, Sybase, DB2...etc


SQL Role
---------

SQL is not itself a database management system, nor it is a standalone product.
we can't go into computer store and "Buy the Sql" like other products 

SQL is a internal part of a DBMS, a language and a tool for communicating with the DBMS




SQL Features and Benefits
-------------------------

Vendor independence


SQL standards


High-level, English-like structure

Relationships(E-R Diagrams): 
----------------------------

before star working with any Sql related work the first thing we need to do is creating the basic structure of the database and planning the database

planning the database
---------------------

planning the database means what is the db name
how many tables we need to create 
what are the values we need to store in each table
what is the relationship between the tables 


to do the all above things we will use the E-R Diagrams 

e-r diagrams (ERD)

e- entity 
r -relationship 

ERD diagrams are used to define the relationship between the entities(tables) and attributes ...etc  


Identify the following things

first identify how many entities we need for the project 
then categorize them based on the requirements
NOTE: each entity(table) should exactly contain a particular task data(related information)
define the attributes for each entity(table) and list all the (properties or field) describe the attributes(choose the proper datatype)
these attributes are nothing but columns of the tables
identify the relationship between the tables


Different Types of relationships
--------------------------------
we have three types of relationships only 

one to one
one to many
many to one
many to many

refer to : relationship Examples file



PK and FK
---------

primary key
-----------

primary key is used to identify the each record of the table
the main purpose of the primary is when we try to fetch the record from the table we will pass the primary key main argument to fetch the record among
all the available records

each row(record) in a table will contains the primary key

if you mention any field(attribute or property) as a primary key then we can't duplicate that key throughout the table records

we can't generate the primary key manually or we can make Sql to generate the PK automatically 

when say automatically we will use auto-increment in Sql


Foreign Key
-----------

foreign key is used to identify the other tables record inside the current table 
example
in student table we have a field called fee_contribution_id which we marked as foreign key then the same field 
the the student_fee_contribution table will act like a primary key

here in the student table we use fee_contribution_id to identify the other table(student_fee_contribution) table records 

the main purpose of the foreign key is to simplify the tables structures 
in simple terms we call this a normalization process( deviding the big table into multiple tables and creating the relationship between them using FK)
